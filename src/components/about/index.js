            Front-end web developer leveraging my background in biological and physical sciences to aid in the critical thinking required to build intuitive and responsive user experiences on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of Wisconsin Coding, with freshly developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. Known as a creative critical thinking problem solver with a passion for developing apps with an emphasis on app individuality. With every project, my goal is to fully engage and immerse my audience for the most impactful user experience. I have applied aspects of both front-end and back-end technologies in my most recent project. I worked with a team of six to develop a single-page MERN app that allows users to participate in raffle giveaways. Iâ€™m excited to show off my new found skills within a fast-paced, quality-focused team to create better experiences on the world wide web.
